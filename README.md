# epimutacions

`epimutacions` is a R package to detect epimutations from DNA methylation data. epimutacions will be developed during Europe Biohackathon 2020. 

## Background

Diagnoses of patients with rare disease is currently performed with tools that tools explore genetic and genomic mutations. Despite the great success of genetics to diagnose these patients, around 60% of the cases still remained undiagnosed. Epimutations, aberrant methylation pattern of contiguous CpGs, can be an underlying cause of undiagnosed patients. However, there are no robust methods to diagnose these aberrations.

## Objective

Our aim during the Biohackathon is to implement different approaches to detect epimutations in a R package, following Bioconductor guidelines. Thus, we will work on three main directions:

1. Implementation of approaches to detect epimutations
2. Implementation of plotting and repporting funcionts
3. Preparation of documentation. 

More information of the background and the rationale can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/yocra3/epimutacions/wiki). A more specific description of the tasks available can be found in the [projects tab](https://github.com/yocra3/epimutacions/projects/1). 

## How to collaborate

If you are interested in collaborating with our project, you can join us in our channel (5_epimutations) in BioHackEU20 slack. 

### Before the Biohackathon

We are open to implement different approaches to detect epimutations. If you have any idea, we can discuss it via slack or via mail.

### During the Biohackathon

In the Biohackathon, we will be focused in writing R code. If you have experienced with R, Bioconductor and/or plotting, feel free to contact us via slack. 

### After the Biohackathon

We will evaluate the methods implemented in `epimutacions` in DNA methylation datasets. Collaborations to apply our dataset to new datasets can be considered.
